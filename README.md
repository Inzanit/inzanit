<h1 align="center">Hey there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Patrick, I'm a senior C# software developer and contribute to open source when I can. During the day I work for a bespoke software house, during the evenings I play video games and over the weekend I usually go out. You can find me in several places and I'm always trying out new tech, so don't be surprised if there's something new that pops up here once in a while.
